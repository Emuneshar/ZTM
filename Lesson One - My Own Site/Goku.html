        <h2>About Son Goku</h2>
        <p>Son Goku, otherwise known as Goku, is the main character of our favorite anime. He's the hero who the story follows from the very first episode.</p>
        <p>He starts off his journey as an alien child who is sent to Earth from a dying race of advanced alien realtors. A race of aliens called saiyans who buy and sell planets</p>
        <p>As a child he was sent to Earth to prepare it for sale but got hit on the head as a baby and the rest is history. A martial arts prodigy Goku went from being a low born saiyan with limited potential to literally achieving the power of the gods.</p>
        <p>One of the things that I admire the most about Goku is his impeccable work ethic and how he has a knack for turning enemies into friends. I believe there is something we can all learn from him.</p>
